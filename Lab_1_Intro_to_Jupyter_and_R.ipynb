If one thought that births were roughly equally likely to be boys or girls, then one might expect that there would be years with more girls born than boys and more girls baptized than boys. Why was this not observed? Were births more likely to be boys than girls, such that there were always more boys born than girls and hence more boys baptized? Were births roughly equally likely to be boys or girls, but boys were more likely to be baptized? Are the other possible explanations?\n",

    "This command returns 82 values of either TRUE if that year had more boys baptized than girls baptized, or FALSE if that year did not (the answer may surprise you). This output shows a different kind of data than we have considered so far. In the `arbuthnot` data frame our values are numerical (the number of `boys` baptized and `girls` baptized). Here, we have asked R to create logical data, data where the values are either TRUE or FALSE. Note that this would be considered a categorical variable. Each year is put into one of two possible categories, indicating whether the year had more boys baptized or more girls baptized. In general, data analysis will involve many different kinds of data types, and one reason for using R is that it is able to represent and compute with many of them."
