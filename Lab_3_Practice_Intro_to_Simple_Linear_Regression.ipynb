    "The regression equation may be used to predict `y` at any value of `x`. When predictions are made for values of `x` that are beyond the range of the observed data, it is referred to as **extrapolation** and is not usually recommended. However, predictions made within the range of the data are more reliable. In a subsequent lab we will consider an R function that may be used for prediction, but for now we will rely upon calculations by hand."
