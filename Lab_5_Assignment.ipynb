    "## Peanut Allergy Experiment in Young Children\n",
    "\n",
    "In the late 1990s, it was believed that young children should exclude peanuts from their diets to reduce the chance of developing an allergy. In 2008, researchers were no longer so sure. This study involves more than 500 young children who had exhibited other allergic responses, such as sever eczema, egg allergy, or both. The study is interested in determining whether peanut exposure is helpful or harmful among such children. A peanut diet regimen (**consume** or **avoid**) was randomly assigned to over 500 such young children during years 2-5, ages during which children had previously been told not to eat peanuts. The key outcome was testing for a peanut allergy when each child turned 5.  In order to determine whether diet regimen is associated with developing peanut allergy, it is necessary to analyze the results of this study, beginning with some numerical and graphical summaries of the data.\n",
