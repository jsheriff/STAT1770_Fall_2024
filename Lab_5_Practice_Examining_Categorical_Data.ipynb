    "Since the interest is in comparing the proportions of males who have smoked to the proportion of females who have smoked, we usually want to estimate the relevant proportions for each group. The `prop.table` function is an easy way to accomplish this. It takes a table of counts and converts those counts into proportions. The default for `prop.table` is to convert counts into proportions of the overall total. However, the `margin` argument allows you to specify row proportions (`margin = 1`) or column proportions (`margin = 2`). ***In our table the rows refer to gender, which means that row proportions will be of primary interest***. Use the `prop.table` function below to compare the various options. Since the `prop.table` function uses a table of counts as its input, we could save the table of counts as an object to be used by the `prop.table`function.  "
